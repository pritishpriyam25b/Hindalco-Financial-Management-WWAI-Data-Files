🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes strategic capital allocation decisions for Hindalco Industries Ltd., with a specific focus on evaluating circular economy (aluminium recycling) investments under market volatility and ESG constraints.

The analysis integrates:

Classical corporate finance models (CAPM, WACC, beta)

Risk–return and capital structure diagnostics

AI-assisted analytics and visualization

An interactive, finance-grade dashboard for managerial interpretation

The objective is to determine whether project-specific hurdle rates provide superior capital allocation outcomes compared to firm-level WACC in cyclical industries.

🎯 Key Questions Addressed

Is Hindalco’s current capital structure close to optimal?

Does firm-level WACC misprice green / recycling projects?

How does project risk differ from firm risk?

What are the implications for shareholder value and financial flexibility?
